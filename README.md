# Predicting-Fraud
This project was part of my individual academic assignment for ACX3300 - Predictive Analytics in Accounting. I developed a fraud detection model using logistic regression and machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The project involved:

Data preparation, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and resampling to address class imbalance.
Applied logistic regression to predict accounting fraud based on financial variables, optimizing the model using feature selection.
Visualized and evaluated the model's performance through accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics.
Explored alternative machine learning models like decision trees and KNN to improve prediction accuracy.
